Going from R (or python probably) to Rust is seeming to be a very difficult task. Documented here are a few of the main hangups I keep hitting because they aren't present in R (or python really).

Result, Option, Enums. 

Rust uses a kind of 'wrapper' around the objects that I'm used to passing around as I write code. In R, I just use function(thing) and my function does it's work on the thing. You have to be a little more concise in Rust.

Read the Rust book. The whole thing.

I read the first few chapters 


It's reminding me of back when I started programming and doing something trivial took days. For example, there are a million ways to open a file in Rust. This is because of Rust's power: opening a file could mean opening it all at once or one line at a time (what even defines a line?), through a socket, distributed across many machines and/or across machines with different architechtures.
